 Creating the webpage Mirror Fashion

 First step: 
 1- Building the first html page called "Sobre.HTML", in addition to creating a CSS and JS folder.

 2 - Styling the page "SOBRE.HTML" using the selectors from file "SOBRE.HTML"

 3 - Today I changed the layout from file "INDEX.HTML", adding structure on the header and putting more sections organizing your places. Besides this changeds, I taked from the internet the code Reset CSS, acording the class Alura. (Nice, have a good day code all us!)

 4 - Creating the sales part of the panel and organizing your positions.

 5 - Adding the TAG FOOTER in the file "SOBRE.HTML and INDEX.HTML".

 6 - With the "extension live" turned on, you can opening the node.js, and execute the command "node install express", for you putting on your project the dependencies, after that you can create a file called "server.js" and start to writting the lines of the codes for it works like a  virtual server, besides the confige your server, you need to let it  with "nodemon" turned on too. For it you can put the command "npm install nodemon -D", this make it a restarting all the time when gotta a changed.
