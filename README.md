 Creating the webpage Mirror Fashion

 First step: 
 1- Building the first html page called "Sobre.HTML", in addition to creating a CSS and JS folder.

 2 - Styling the page "SOBRE.HTML" using the selectors from file "SOBRE.HTML"

 3 - Today I changed the layout from file "INDEX.HTML", adding structure on the header and putting more sections organizing your places. Besides this changeds, I taked from the internet the code Reset CSS, acording the class Alura. (Nice, have a good day code all us!)

 4 - Creating the sales part of the panel and organizing your positions.

 5 - Adding the TAG FOOTER in the file "SOBRE.HTML and INDEX.HTML".
